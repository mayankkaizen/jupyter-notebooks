    "### Percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no universally accepted definition of a percentile. Using the 65th percentile as an example, the 65th percentile can be defined as the lowest score that is greater than 65% of the scores. This is the way we defined it above and we will call this “Definition 1.” The 65th percentile can also be defined as the smallest score that is greater than or equal to 65% of the scores. This we will call “Definition 2.” Unfortunately, these two definitions can lead to dramatically different results, especially when there is relatively little data. Moreover, neither of these definitions is explicit about how to handle rounding. We'll stick to following method to compute the percentile. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following example. Consider the 25th percentile for the 8 numbers in Table 1. Notice the numbers are given ranks ranging from 1 for the lowest number to 8 for the highest number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Number|Rank\n",
    "------|----\n",
    "3|1\n",
    "5|2\n",
    "7|3\n",
    "8|4\n",
    "9|5\n",
    "11|6\n",
    "13|7\n",
    "15|8\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to compute the rank (R) of the 25th percentile. This is done using the following formula:-\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = P/100*(N+1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where **P** is the desired percentile (25 in this case) and **N** is the number of numbers (8 in this case). Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = 25/100*(9) = 2.25$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If R is an integer, the Pth percentile is be the number with rank R. When R is not an integer, we compute the Pth percentile by interpolation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define IR as the integer portion of R (the number to the left of the decimal point). For this example, IR = 2.\n",
    "2. Define FR as the fractional portion of R. For this example, FR = 0.25.\n",
    "3. Find the scores with Rank IR and with Rank IR + 1. For this example, this means the score with Rank 2 and the score with Rank 3. The scores are 5 and 7.\n",
    "4. Interpolate by multiplying the difference between the scores by FR and add the result to the lower score. For these data, this is (0.25)(7 - 5) + 5 = 5.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the 25th percentile is 5.5. If we had used the first definition (the smallest score greater than 25% of the scores), the 25th percentile would have been 7. If we had used the second definition (the smallest score greater than or equal to 25% of the scores), the 25th percentile would have been 5."

    "#### Variance Sum Law I\n",

The question is, “What is the variance of this sum?” For example, suppose the two populations are the populations of 8- year old males and 8-year-old females in Houston, Texas, and that the variable of interest is memory span. You repeat the following steps thousands of times: (1)\n",
    "law I sample one male and one female, (2) measure the memory span of each, and (3) sum the two memory spans. After you have done this thousands of times, you compute the variance of the sum. It turns out that the variance of this sum can be computed according to the following formula:\n",

    "The variance of the sampling distribution of the mean is ${\\sigma}^2/N$\n",

    "This expression can be derived very easily from the variance sum law. Let's begin by computing the variance of the sampling distribution of the sum of three numbers sampled from a population with variance $σ^2$. The variance of\n",
    "the sum would be $σ^2 + σ^2 + σ^2$. For N numbers, the variance would be N$σ^2$. Since the mean is $1/N$ times the sum, the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean would be $1/N^2$ times the variance of the sum, which equals $σ^2/N$.\n",
    "The standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. It is therefore the square root of the variance of the sampling distribution of the mean and can be written as:\n",

    "#### Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "Some estimates are based on more information than others. For example, an estimate of the variance based on a sample size of 100 is based on more information than an estimate of the variance based on a sample size of 5. The degrees of freedom (df) of an estimate is the number of independent pieces of information on which the estimate is based.\n",
    "As an example, let's say that we know that the mean height of Martians is 6 and wish to estimate the variance of their heights. We randomly sample one Martian and find that its height is 8. Recall that the variance is defined as the mean squared deviation of the values from their population mean. We can compute the squared deviation of our value of 8 from the population mean of 6 to find a single squared deviation from the mean. This single squared deviation from the mean $(8-6)^2 = 4$ is an estimate of the mean squared deviation for all Martians. Therefore, based on this sample of one, we would estimate that the population variance is 4. This estimate is based on a single piece of information and therefore has 1 df. If we sampled another Martian and obtained a height of 5, then we could compute a second estimate of the variance, $(5-6)^2 = 1$. We could then average our two estimates (4 and 1) to obtain an estimate of 2.5. Since this estimate is based on two independent pieces of information, it has two degrees of freedom. The two estimates are independent because they are based on two independently and randomly selected Martians. The estimates would not be independent if after sampling one Martian, we decided to choose its brother as our second Martian.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are probably thinking, it is pretty rare that we know the population mean when we are estimating the variance. Instead, we have to first estimate the population mean (μ) with the sample mean (M). The process of estimating the mean affects our degrees of freedom as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our problem of estimating the variance in Martian heights, let's assume we do not know the population mean and therefore we have to estimate it from the sample. We have sampled two Martians and found that their heights are 8 and 5. Therefore M, our estimate of the population mean, is M =  (8 + 5)/2 = 6.5\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now compute two estimates of variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Estimate 1 = (8-6.5)2 = 2.25\n",
    "      Estimate 2 = (5-6.5)2 = 2.25"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "Now for the key question: Are these two estimates independent? The answer is no because each height contributed to the calculation of M. Since the first Martian's height of 8 influenced M, it also influenced Estimate 2. If the first height had been, for example, 10, then M would have been 7.5 and Estimate 2 would have been (5-7.5)2 = 6.25 instead of 2.25. The important point is that the two estimates are not independent and therefore we do not have two degrees of freedom. "

    "In general, the degrees of freedom for an estimate is equal to the number of values minus the number of parameters estimated en route to the estimate in question. In the Martians example, there are two values (8 and 5) and we had to estimate one parameter (μ) on the way to estimating the parameter of interest ($σ^2$). Therefore, the estimate of variance has 2 - 1 = 1 degree of freedom. If we had sampled 12 Martians, then our estimate of variance would have had 11 degrees of freedom. Therefore, the degrees of freedom of an estimate of variance is equal to N - 1 where N is the number of observations.\n",

    "Let's compare two weighing scales. Scale 1 is a very high-tech digital scale and gives essentially the same weight each time you weigh yourself; it varies by at most 0.02 pounds from weighing to weighing. Although this scale has the potential to be very accurate, it is calibrated incorrectly and, on average, overstates your weight by one pound. Scale 2 is a cheap scale and gives very different results from weighing to weighing. However, it is just as likely to underestimate as overestimate your weight. Sometimes it vastly overestimates it and sometimes it vastly underestimates it. However, the average of a large number of measurements would be your actual weight. Scale 1 is biased since, on average, its measurements are one pound higher than your actual weight. Scale 2, by contrast, gives unbiased estimates of your weight. However, Scale 2 is highly variable and its measurements are often very far from your true weight. Scale 1, in spite of being biased, is fairly accurate. Its measurements are never more than 1.02 pounds from your actual weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistic is biased if the long-term average value of the statistic is not the parameter it is estimating. More formally, a statistic is biased if the mean of the sampling distribution of the statistic is not equal to the parameter.

    "the statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw elsewhere that the sampling distribution of the mean, the mean of the sampling distribution of the (sample) mean is the population mean (μ).

For example, for normal distributions, the standard error of the median is larger than the standard error of the mean. The smaller the standard error of a statistic, the more efficient the statistic. The relative efficiency of two statistics is typically defined as the ratio of their standard errors. However, it is sometimes defined as the ratio of their squared standard errors."

    "In normal distributions 95% of the area of a normal distribution is within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, if you randomly sampled a value from a normal distribution with a mean of 100, the probability it would be within 1.96σ of 100 is 0.95. Similarly, if you sample N values from the population, the probability that the sample mean (M) will be within 1.96 σM of 100 is 0.95.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we do not know the standard deviation? You sample N values and compute the sample mean (M) and estimate the standard error of the mean ($σ_M$) with $s_M$. What is the probability that M will be within 1.96 $s_M$ of the population mean (μ)? We can't be sure. \n",

    "> t- distribution is any member of family of continuous probability distributions that arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the **sample size is too small and the population standard deviation is unknown**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the normal distribution has relatively more scores in the center of the distribution and the t distribution has relatively more in the tails. The t distribution is therefore leptokurtic. The t distribution approaches the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase.\n",

    "Since the t distribution is leptokurtic, the percentage of the distribution within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean is less than the 95% for the normal distribution. Table 1 shows the number of standard deviations from the mean required to contain 95% and 99% of the area of the t distribution for various degrees of freedom. These are the values of t that you use in a confidence interval. The corresponding values for the normal distribution are 1.96 and 2.58 respectively. Notice that with few degrees of freedom, the values of t are much higher than the corresponding values for a normal distribution and that the difference decreases as the degrees of freedom increase.\n",
