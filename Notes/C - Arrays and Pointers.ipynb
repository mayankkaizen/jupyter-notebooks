    "Rather more surprising, at first sight, is the fact that a reference to `a[i]` can also be written as `*(a+i)`. In evaluating `a[i]`, C converts it to `*(a+i)` immediately; the two forms are equivalent. Applying the operator `&` to both parts of this equivalence, it follows that `&a[i]` and `a+i` are also identical: `a+i` is the address of the `i`-th element beyond `a`. As the other side of this coin, if `pa` is a pointer, expressions might use it with a subscript; `pa[i]` is identical to `*(pa+i)`. In short, an array-and-index expression is equivalent to one written as a pointer and offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one difference between an array name and a pointer that must be kept in mind. A pointer is a variable, so `pa=a` and `pa++` are legal. But an array name is not a variable; constructions like `a=pa` and `a++` are illegal.\n",

    "The subscript notation `x[i]` (where `x` designates a pointer) is syntactic sugar for `*(x+i)`. Taking advantage of the compiler's knowledge of the pointer type, the address that `x + i` points to is not the base address (pointed to by `x`) incremented by `i` bytes, but rather is defined to be the base address incremented by `i` multiplied by the size of an element that `x` points to. Thus, `x[i]` designates the `i+1`th element of the array.\n",

    "Furthermore, in most expression contexts (a notable exception is as operand of `sizeof`), the name of an array is automatically converted to a pointer to the array's first element. This implies that an array is never copied as a whole when named as an argument to a function, but rather only the address of its first element is passed. Therefore, although function calls in C use pass-by-value semantics, arrays are in effect passed by reference. \n",

Even though the name of an array is, in most expression contexts, converted into a pointer (to its first element), this pointer does not itself occupy any storage; the array name is not an l-value, and its address is a constant, unlike a pointer variable. Consequently, what an array \"points to\" cannot be changed, and it is impossible to assign a new address to an array name.\n",

Using pointer arithmetic syntax, `x[y]` can also be written as `*(x+y)`.\n",

    "For this to work with a normal array, such as our `a`, the name `a` in `a[3]` must first be converted to a pointer (to the first element in `a`).

The value of the variable `intPtr` is also (`int*`) and it is set to point to a single integer `i`. So what's the difference between `intArray` and `intPtr`? Not much as far as the compiler is concerned. They are both just (`int*`) pointers, and the compiler is perfectly happy to apply the `[]` or `+` syntax to either. It's the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the elements referred to by a `[]` or `+` operation really are there. Really its' just the same old rule that C doesn't do any bounds checking.

The ASCII code 0 is the NUL character that marks the end of a string. And the  ASCII codes 1 through 9 are special characters used in some communication protocols. ASCII code 7 is a bell; on some terminals, printing it makes a sound.\n",

    "A careful observer will notice that they differ by a single bit. And this pattern holds for the rest of the letters; the sixth bit (counting from the right) acts as a “case bit”, 0 for upper-case letters and 1 for lower case letters. As an exercise, write a function that takes a string and converts from lowercase to upper-case by flipping the sixth bit. As a challenge, you can make a faster version by reading the string 32 or 64 bits at a time, rather than one character at a time. This optimization is made easier if the length of the string is a multiple of 4 or 8 bytes. If you read past the end of a string, you are likely to see strange characters. Conversely, if you write a string and then accidentally read it as an int or float, the results will be hard to interpret. For example, if you run:\n",
