This is called a character constant, although it is just another way to write a small integer. So, for example, 'A' is a character constant; in the ASCII character set its value is 65, the internal representation of the character A. Of course, 'A' is to be preferred over 65: its meaning is obvious, and it is independent of a particular character set. \n",

    "\n",
    "##### Call by value:\n",
    "\n",
    " - In call by value method, the value of the variable is passed to the function as parameter.\n",
    " - The value of the actual parameter can not be modified by formal parameter.\n",
    " - Different Memory is allocated for both actual and formal parameters. Because, value of actual parameter is copied to formal parameter.\n",

    "A careful observer will notice that they differ by a single bit. And this pattern holds for the rest of the letters; the sixth bit (counting from the right) acts as a “case bit”, 0 for upper-case letters and 1 for lower case letters. As an exercise, write a function that takes a string and converts from lowercase to upper-case by flipping the sixth bit. As a challenge, you can make a faster version by reading the string 32 or 64 bits at a time, rather than one character at a time. This optimization is made easier if the length of the string is a multiple of 4 or 8 bytes. If you read past the end of a string, you are likely to see strange characters. Conversely, if you write a string and then accidentally read it as an int or float, the results will be hard to interpret. For example, if you run:\n",
