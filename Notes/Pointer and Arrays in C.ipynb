In evaluating `a[i]`, C converts it to `*(a+i)` immediately; the two forms are equivalent. Applying the operator `&` to both parts of this equivalence, it follows that `&a[i]` and `a+i` are also identical: `a+i` is the address of the `i`-th element beyond `a`. As the other side of this coin, if `pa` is a pointer, expressions might use it with a subscript; `pa[i]` is identical to `*(pa+i)`. In short, an array-and-index expression is equivalent to one written as a pointer and offset.\n",

    "The subscript notation `x[i]` (where `x` designates a pointer) is syntactic sugar for `*(x+i)`. Taking advantage of the compiler's knowledge of the pointer type, the address that `x + i` points to is not the base address (pointed to by `x`) incremented by `i` bytes, but rather is defined to be the base address incremented by `i` multiplied by the size of an element that `x` points to. Thus, `x[i]` designates the `i+1`th element of the array.\n",

    "Furthermore, in most expression contexts (a notable exception is as operand of `sizeof`), the name of an array is automatically converted to a pointer to the array's first element. This implies that an array is never copied as a whole when named as an argument to a function, but rather only the address of its first element is passed. Therefore, although function calls in C use pass-by-value semantics, arrays are in effect passed by reference. \n",

    "Thus, despite this apparent equivalence between array and pointer variables, there is still a distinction to be made between them. Even though the name of an array is, in most expression contexts, converted into a pointer (to its first element), this pointer does not itself occupy any storage; the array name is not an l-value, and its address is a constant, unlike a pointer variable. Consequently, what an array \"points to\" cannot be changed, and it is impossible to assign a new address to an array name.\n",

    "The reason that this works is that the array dereferencing operator in C, `[ ]`, is defined in terms of pointers. `x[y]` means: start with the pointer `x`, step `y` elements forward after what the pointer points to, and then take whatever is there. Using pointer arithmetic syntax, `x[y]` can also be written as `*(x+y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work with a normal array, such as our `a`, the name `a` in `a[3]` must first be converted to a pointer (to the first element in `a`). Then we step 3 elements forward, and take whatever is there. In other words: take the element at position 3 in the array. (Which is the fourth element in the array, since the first one is numbered 0.)\n",

    "So, in summary, array names in a C program are (in most cases) converted to pointers. One exception is when we use the sizeof operator on an array. If a was converted to a pointer in this context, `sizeof a` would give the size of a pointer and not of the actual array, which would be rather useless, so in that case `a` means the array itself.\n",

    "One effect of the C array scheme is that the compiler does not distinguish meaningfully between arrays and pointers-- they both just look like pointers. In the above example, the value of `intArray` is a pointer to the first element in the array so it's an `(int*)`. The value of the variable `intPtr` is also (`int*`) and it is set to point to a single integer `i`. So what's the difference between `intArray` and `intPtr`? Not much as far as the compiler is concerned. They are both just (`int*`) pointers, and the compiler is perfectly happy to apply the `[]` or `+` syntax to either. It's the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the elements referred to by a `[]` or `+` operation really are there. Really its' just the same old rule that C doesn't do any bounds checking. C thinks of the single integer `i` as just a sort of degenerate array of size 1."
