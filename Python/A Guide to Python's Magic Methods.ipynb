    "#### 1 - Construction and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone knows the most basic magic method, `__init__`. It's the way that we can define the initialization behavior of an object. However, when I call `x = SomeClass()`,` __init__` is not the first thing to get called. Actually, it's a method called `__new__`, which actually creates the instance, then passes any arguments at creation on to the initializer. At the other end of the object's lifespan, there's `__del__`. Let's take a closer look at these 3 magic methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`__new__(cls, [...)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "`__new__` is the firrst method to get called in an object's instantiation. It takes the class, then any other arguments that it will pass along to `__init__`. `__new__` is used fairly rarely, but it does have its purposes, particularly when subclassing an immutable type like a tuple or a string. I don't want to go in to too much detail on\n",
    "`__new__` because it's not too useful, but it is covered in great detail in the Python docs.\n",

    "**`__init__(self, [...)`**\n",

    "The initializer for the class. It gets passed whatever the primary constructor was called with (so, for example, if we called `x = SomeClass(10, 'foo')`, `__init__` would get passed `10` and `foo` as arguments. `__init__` is almost universally used in Python class definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`__del__(self)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "If `__new__` and `__init__` formed the constructor of the object, `__del__` is the destructor. It doesn't implement behavior for the statement `del x` (so that code would not translate to `x.__del__()`). Rather, it defines behavior for when an object is garbage collected. It can be quite useful for objects that might require extra cleanup upon deletion,\n",
    "like sockets or file objects. Be careful, however, as there is no guarantee that `__del__` will be executed if the object is still alive when the interpreter exits, so `__del__` can't serve as a replacement for good coding practices (like always closing a connection when you're done with it). In fact, `__del__` should almost never be used because of the precarious circumstances under which it is called; use it with caution!\n",

    "#### 4 - Controlling Attribute Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people coming to Python from other languages complain that it lacks true encapsulation for classes (e.g. no way to define private attributes and then have public getter and setters). This couldn't be farther than the truth: it just happens that Python accomplishes a great deal of encapsulation through :magic\", instead of explicit modifiers for methods or fields. Take a look:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `__getattr__(self, name)` You can define behavior for when a user attempts to access an attribute that doesn't exist (either at all or yet). This can be useful for catching and redirecting common misspellings, giving warnings about using deprecated attributes (you can still choose to compute and return that attribute, if you wish), or deftly handing an `AttributeError`. It only gets called when a nonexistent attribute is accessed, however, so it isn't a true encapsulation solution.\n",
    " \n",
    " - `__setattr__(self, name, value)` Unlike `__getattr__`, `__setattr__` is an encapsulation solution. It allows you to define behavior for assignment to an attribute regardless of whether or not that attribute exists, meaning you can define custom rules for any changes in the values of attributes. However, you have to be careful with how you use `__setattr__`, as the example at the end of the list will show.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `__delattr__(self, name)` This is the exact same as `__setattr__`, but for deleting attributes instead of setting them. The same precautions need to be taken as with `__setattr__` as well in order to prevent infinite recursion (calling `del self.name` in the implementation of `__delattr__` would cause infinite recursion).\n",
    "\n",
    " - `__getattribute__(self, name)` After all this,` __getattribute__` fits in pretty well with its companions `__setattr__` and `__delattr__`. However, I don't recommend you use it.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `__getattribute__`  It allows you to define rules for whenever an attribute's value is accessed. It suffers from some similar infinite recursion problems as its partners-in-crime (this time you call the base class's `__getattribute__` method to prevent this).\n",
    "\n",
    "It also mainly obviates the need for `__getattr__`, which, when `__getattribute__` is implemented, only gets called if it is called explicitly or an `AttributeError` is raised. This method can be used (after all, it's your choice), but I don't recommend it because it has a small use case (it's far more rare that we need special behavior to retrieve a value than to assign to it) and because it can be really difficult to implement bug-free.\n",

Protocols are somewhat similar to interfaces in other languages in that they give you a set of methods you must define. However, in Python protocols are totally informal and require no explicit declarations to implement. Rather, they're more like guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we talking about protocols now? Because implementing custom container types in Python involves using some of these protocols. First, there's the protocol for defining immutable containers: to make an immutable container, you need only define `__len__` and `__getitem__` (more on these later). The mutable container protocol requires everything that immutable containers require plus `__setitem__` and `__delitem__`. Lastly, if you want your object to be iterable, you'll have to define `__iter__`, which returns an iterator. That iterator must conform to an iterator protocol, which requires iterators to have methods called `__iter__`(returning itself) and `next`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2 The magic behind containers\n",
    "\n",
    " - `__len__(self)` Returns the length of the container. Part of the protocol for both immutable and mutable containers.\n",
    " - `__getitem__(self, key)` Defines behavior for when an item is accessed, using the notation `self[key]`. This is also part of both the mutable and immutable container protocols. It should also raise appropriate exceptions: `TypeError` if the type of the key is wrong and `KeyError` if there is no corresponding value for the key.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `__setitem__(self, key, value)` Defines behavior for when an item is assigned to, using the notation `self[key] = value`. This is part of the mutable container protocol. Again, you should raise `KeyError` and `TypeError` where appropriate.\n",
    " - `__delitem__(self, key)` Defines behavior for when an item is deleted (e.g. `del self[key]`). This is only part of the mutable container protocol. You must raise the appropriate exceptions when an invalid key is used.\n",
    " - `__iter__(self)` Should return an iterator for the container. Iterators are returned in a number\n",
    "of contexts, most notably by the `iter()` built-in function and when a container is looped over using the form `for x in container:`. Iterators are their own objects, and they also must define an `__iter__` method that returns self.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `__reversed__(self)` Called to implement behavior for the `reversed()` built in function. Should return a reversed version of the sequence. Implement this only if the sequence class is ordered, like list or tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `__contains__(self, item)` `__contains__` defines behavior for membership tests using `in` and `not in`. Why isn't this part of a sequence protocol, you ask? Because when `__contains__` isn't defined, Python just iterates over the sequence and returns `True` if it comes across the item it's looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `__missing__(self, key)` `__missing__` is used in subclasses of dict. It defines behavior for whenever a key is accessed that does not exist in a dictionary (so, for instance, if I had a dictionary d and said `d[\"george\"]` when \"george\" is not a key in the dict, `d.__missing__(\"george\")` would be called)."

    " - `__exit__(self, exception_type, exception_value, traceback)` Defines what the context manager should do after its block has been executed (or terminates). It can be used to handle exceptions, perform cleanup, or do something always done immediately after the action in the block. If the block executes successfully, exception_type, exception_value, and traceback will be `None`. Otherwise, you can choose to handle the exception or let the user handle it; if you want to handle it, make sure `__exit__` returns `True` after all is said and done.

The tuple contains between 2 and 5 elements: a callable object that is called to recreate the object, a tuple of arguments for that callable object, state to be passed to `__setstate__`(optional), an iterator yielding list items to be pickled (optional), and an iterator yielding dictionary items to be pickled (optional).\n",

    "Here, we document a few major places where Python 3 differs from 2.x in terms of its object model:\n",
    " - Since the distinction between string and unicode has been done away with in Python 3, `__unicode__` is gone and `__bytes__` (which behaves similarly to `__str__` and `__unicode__` in 2.7) exists for a new built-in for constructing byte arrays.\n",
    " - Since division defaults to true division in Python 3, `__div__` is gone in Python 3\n",
    " - `__coerce__` is gone due to redundancy with other magic methods and confusing behavior\n",
    " - `__cmp__` is gone due to redundancy with other magic methods\n",
    " - `__nonzero__` has been renamed to `__bool__`"
