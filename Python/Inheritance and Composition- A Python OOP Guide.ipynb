    "Inheritance and composition are two important concepts in OOP that model the relationship between two classes. Both of them enable code reuse, but they do it in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance models what is called an **is a** relationship. This means that when you have a`Derived` class that inherits from a `Base` class, you created a relationship where `Derived` **is a** specialized version of `Base`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is represented using the **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "/insert image\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are represented as boxes with the class name on top. The inheritance relationship is represented by an arrow from the derived class pointing to the base class. The word **extends** is usually added to the arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a base class `Animal` and you derive from it to create a `Horse` class. The inheritance relationship states that a `Horse` **is an** `Animal`. This means that `Horse` inherits the interface and implementation of `Animal`, and `Horse` objects can be used to replace `Animal` objects in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the **Liskov substitution principle**. The principle states that \"in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of Type S without altering any of the desired properties of the program\".\n",

    "#### What's Composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a concept that models a **has a** relationship. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types. This means that a class `Composite` can contain an object of another class `Component`. This relationship means that a `Composite` **has a** `Component`. \n",
    "\n",
    "UML represents composition as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "/insert image\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is represented through a line with a diamond at the composite class pointing to the component class. The composite side can express the cardinality of the relationship. The cardinality indicates the number or valid range of `Component` instances the `Composite` class will contain. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, the 1 represents that the `Composite` class contains one object of type `Component`. Cardinality can be expressed in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **A number** indicates the number of `Component` instances that are contained in the `Composite`.\n",
    " - **The * symbol ** indicates that the `Composite` class can contain a variable number of `Component` instances. \n",
    " - **A range 1..4** indicates that the `Composite` class can contain a range of `Component` instances. The range is indicated with the mininum and maximum numbert of instances, or mininum and many instances like in **1..***"

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">Note - Classes that contain objects of other classes are usually referred to as composites, where classes that are used to create more complex types are referred to as components</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, your `Horse` class can be composed by another object of type `Tail`. Composition allows you to express that relationship by saying a `Horse` **has a** `Tail`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition enables you to reuse code by adding objects to other objects, as opposed to inheriting the interface and implementation of other classes. Both `Horse` and `Dog` classes can leverage the functionality of `Tail` through composition without deriving one class from the other. "

    "#### Inheriting Multiple Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the few modern programming languages that supports multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance is the ability to derive a class from multiple base classes at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance has a bad reputation to the extent that most modern programming languages don’t support it. Instead, modern programming languages support the concept of interfaces. In those languages, you inherit from a single base class and then implement multiple interfaces, so your class can be re-used in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach puts some constraints in your designs. You can only inherit the implementation of one class by directly deriving from it. You can implement multiple interfaces, but you can’t inherit the implementation of multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constraint is good for software design because it forces you to design your classes with fewer dependencies on each other. You will see later in this article that you can leverage multiple implementations through composition, which makes software more flexible. This section, however, is about multiple inheritance, so let’s take a look at how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that sometimes temporary secretaries are hired when there is too much paperwork to do. The `TemporarySecretary` class performs the role of a `Secretary` in the context of the `ProductivitySystem`, but for payroll purposes, it is an `HourlyEmployee`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You look at your class design. It has grown a little bit, but you can still understand how it works. It seems you have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Derive from `Secretary`:** You can derive from `Secretary` to inherit the `.work()` method for the role, and then override the `.calculate_payroll()` method to implement it as an `HourlyEmployee`.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Derive from `HourlyEmployee`:** You can derive from `HourlyEmployee` to inherit the `.calculate_payroll()` method, and then override the `.work()` method to implement it as a `Secretary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you remember that Python supports multiple inheritance, so you decide to derive from both `Secretary` and `HourlyEmployee`:\n",

    "## Composition in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is an object oriented design concept that models a has a relationship. In composition, a class known as composite contains an object of another class known to as component. In other words, a composite class has a component of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition allows composite classes to reuse the implementation of the components it contains. The composite class doesn’t inherit the component class interface, but it can leverage its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition relation between two classes is considered loosely coupled. That means that changes to the component class rarely affect the composite class, and changes to the composite class never affect the component class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides better adaptability to change and allows applications to introduce new requirements without affecting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at two competing software designs, one based on inheritance and another based on composition, the composition solution usually is the most flexible. You can now look at how composition works.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve already used composition in our examples. If you look at the `Employee` class, you’ll see that it contains two attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. `id` to identify an employee.\n",
    " 2. `name` to contain the name of the employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two attributes are objects that the `Employee` class has. Therefore, you can say that an `Employee` **has an** `id` and **has a** `name`.\n",
