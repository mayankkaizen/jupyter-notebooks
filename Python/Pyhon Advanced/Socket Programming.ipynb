    "In this case, both the client and the server run on the same computer. A socket has a corresponding port number, which is 23456 in our case. If desired, you may choose a different port number from the unrestricted number range between 1024 and 65535.\n",

The retrieval of the hostname, the fully qualified domain name, and the IP address is done by the methods `gethostname()`, `getfqdn()`, and `gethostbyname()` respectively. \n",

In the `while` loop the server waits for incoming requests and accepts them using the `accept()` method. The data submitted by the client is read via `recv()` method as chunks of 64 bytes, and simply output to stdout. Finally, the current connection is closed if no further data is sent from the client.
