    "#### Daemon vs. Non-Daemon Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, the example programs have implicitly waited to exit until all threads have completed their work. Sometimes programs spawn a thread as a daemon that runs without blocking the main program from exiting. Using daemon threads is useful for services where there may not be an easy way to interrupt the thread, or where letting the thread die in the middle of its work does not lose or corrupt data (for example, a thread that generates “heart beats” for a service monitoring tool). To mark a thread as a daemon, pass `daemon=True` when constructing it or call its `set_daemon()` method with `True`. The default is for threads to not be daemons."

    "In addition to synchronizing the operations of threads, it is also important to be able to control access to shared resources to prevent corruption or missed data. Python’s built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.) are thread-safe as a side-effect of having atomic byte-codes for manipulating them (the global interpreter lock used to protect Python’s internal data structures is not released in the middle of an update). Other data structures implemented in Python, or simpler types like integers and floats, do not have that protection. To guard against simultaneous access to an object, use a `Lock` object."
