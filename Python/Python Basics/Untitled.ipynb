    "I've compiled many links below. You'll notice that half the links are from Stack Overflow site because the quality of answers/discussions is simply amazing. I also advice you to check every article from [Real Python site](https://realpython.com/) as the quality and depth of their articles are unmatched. Additionally, [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) book is must. See if you can lay your hands on second edition. I've generally avoided posting tutorial/cheatsheets type of links (except for some Real Python articles). I've also avoided links related to Numpy, Pandas etc as those aren't about *pure Python*. \n",
