    "Suppose Alice has prepared a qubit $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta |1\\rangle$ and gives it Bob. Under ideal conditions, Bob can do whatever he wishes with this qubit and all the results would be *as expected* because the qubit Bob has received is exactly the same qubit Alice has prepared. And Alice is 100% sure her qubit is $|\\psi\\rangle$ \n",

The probability that she successfully prepares the required qubit with some probability $p$ or some other qubit $|\\psi^`\\rangle$ with probability $1-p$.

Essentially, you can expect state of one qubit will be either $|0\\rangle$ (with probability 1/2) or $|1\\rangle$ (with probability 1/2) and these states are not in superposition. You can't say the state of the qubit is $\\frac{1}{2}|0\\rangle+\\frac{1}{2}|1\\rangle$. In former case, you'd expect one of 2 possible state.
